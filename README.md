Graphic design assets in this repository are used by the [Nostlan](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan) game launcher.

The skeuomorphic Open Game Box Menu is pretty much complete!

# Why did you do this?

One of my goals for the Nostlan game launcher project was to create a physical object based UI (aka skeuomorphic UI) for archival and nostalgic purposes. For example, the open box menu for Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, a Gamecube game, looks like this:

# How these images were made

I used the Adobe Lightroom app on my iPhone 6S Plus and shoot in Pro mode using the raw .DNG filetype. Photos taken with the default iPhone camera app are compressed in size, reducing image quality and resolution, they don't capture what the sensor is capable of. For lighting I used a desktop light with a white bulb and daylight from a nearby window, not any yellow/orange light sources. I shot from the center of the item, laying it out as flat as possible, trying to avoid reflections. I'm no professional graphic designer but I think the results were quite good if I do say so myself!

## Highly Reflective Items (such as game discs)

If the item was highly reflective, I took two pictures on a tripod and moved the disc relative to my light sources so reflections occurred on opposite sides. Then I could combine the photos and edit out the reflections.

## Editing the Manuals and Memory Cards

I added a transparency layer and erased the backgrounds.

## Editing the Open Game Boxes

To get the edges of the game box to be artificially straight I used photoshop's perspective warp tool. I placed rectangles over each section of the box, then warped those points to be perfectly straight with the edges of the image.

## Editing the Open Game Box Mask

I cut out clips and slots that should appear in front of game media and manuals.

## Editing Discs and other highly reflective items

I aligned the two images so that they matched perfectly then cross-faded between the sides with no reflections. The result looks pretty seamless.
